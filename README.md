LinkedIn Post Generator using Generative AI, LangChain, and Groq
This project leverages Generative AI, LangChain, and Groq to create a LinkedIn post generator. The key features and workflow of the project are as follows:

Data Collection: We collected various posts from a specific LinkedIn influencer and structured the data as JSON inputs.

Processing: Using a Large Language Model (LLM) powered by Groq, the data was processed to extract metadata tags and linguistic details.

Training: The extracted metadata and language insights were used to train the model to generate domain-specific LinkedIn posts.

Post Generation: By providing inputs such as:

Domain: (e.g., Technology, Marketing, etc.)
Post Length: Long, Medium, or Short
Language: Hindi or English
The model can generate tailored LinkedIn posts.

User Interface: The UI for this project is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive experience for users.
